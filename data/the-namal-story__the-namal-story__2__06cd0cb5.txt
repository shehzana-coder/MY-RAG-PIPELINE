Namal University sits on a total of 1000 acres in Pakistan’s Salt Range in an area comprising of hills and crags overlooking Namal Lake in Mianwali District. The Salt Range is a hill system in the Punjab province of Pakistan deriving its name from its extensive deposits of rock salt. This area has a high level of biodiversity and is home to a number of wildlife sanctuaries. Outdoor enthusiasts will find the terrain to be very suited to an eco-progressive lifestyle. From the towering hills on the western side with their hidden sulphur springs, and the Lake to the east with its rocky bank offering stunning sunset views, the rich natural heritage of Namal Valley enhances Namal’s academic experience and offers several opportunities for outdoor activities.
