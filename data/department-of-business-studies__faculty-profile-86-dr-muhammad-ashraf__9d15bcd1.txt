To address these challenges, research has investigated the potential use of biochar in low-fertility and degraded soils to increase soil fertility, nutrient uptake, and water retention, ultimately improving soil productivity and crop growth. A field study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of biochar, coupled with chemical nutrient on the availability of soil nutrient and crop growth. The evaluations comprised measurements of CEC of soil, pH levels of soil, soil bulk density, total nitrogen (N), soil phosphorus (P), SOM, soil texture, extractable potassium (K), and total organic carbon (TOC). Nitrogen fixation by mash beans was also evaluated using xylem solute techniques. This study’s results will contribute valuable insights into the impact of biochar on crop growth and soil health in rain-fed regions.
