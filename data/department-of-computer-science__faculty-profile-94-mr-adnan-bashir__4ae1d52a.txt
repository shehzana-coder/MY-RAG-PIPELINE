Adaptive auditory feedback is based on switching between speech only and non-speech only (i.e., Spearcons) sounds. The auditory
feedback adaptively changes that changing based on user mode.
Active users are assigned with speech only while the engaged users with the non-speech only auditory feedback. Ten participants
perform tasks on desktop computers using within-subject design. The proposed adaptive auditory feedback is more efficient in
comparison to speech only and non-speech auditory feedbacks.
It can also improve a user experience in the desktop environment. Finally, it may help dierent researchers to use adaptive auditory
feedback as a substitute for speech only or non-speech auditory feedback during the designing of accessibility software, tools, and
systems. Courses Professional Practices & Professional Ethics Human-Computer Interaction Software Design & Architecture Object Oriented Analysis & Design Software Requirement Engineering Programming Fundamentals Software Engineering Operating Systems Software Quality Insurance × search
