The objective is to provide an enabling academic and professional environment to our students to nurture a culture of environment protection that is an essential requirement for prosperous and progressive Pakistan. The word GREEN symbolizes the colors of paradise while the word Namal (translated ‘anmoal’ in Urdu) means priceless (invaluable) land. The topography, the landscape, the monuments and the cultural history of Namal valley embraces in its fold the very essence of Green Namal philosophy. The natural world is a source of inspiration for its visual beauty that is the basis for life on earth. The Green Namal initiative is meant to motivate all members of the Namal Family to inculcate a sense of responsibility and commitment to become ecologically conscious individuals. We are committed to the notion that a cleaner & greener environment is essential to our future generations to flourish and thrive in healthy environment. Namal Valley Namal Valley lies some 30 kilometers away from Mianwali city and is nestled amidst the Koh-i-Suleiman and Salt Range along the border area of Punjub and KPK. The valley has a unique topography and boasts numerous lakes of which Namal is most visible. The valley is also speckled with numerous smaller lakes that stretch up to the valley of Soon Sakesar on the highest point of the Salt Range. The economy is largely agrarian with farming and livestock dominating the economic activity in the area. Namal Valley is also known as a sanctuary for many migrant species of birds and animals that thrive in perfect ecosystem. namal lake Namal Lake is the most prominent feature of Namal Valley. It has a surface area of approximately 5 square kilometers and is the largest of the many lakes that are spread across the valley. The surrounding area serves as grazing pastures for animals that the inhabitants of the Valley rear as a source of income. It is an attractive tourist resort as people from across the Namal valley and beyond visit this place as a picnic spot. It also serves as a perfect abode for various species of birds like Russian ducks and Siberian cranes that migrate to this place during winters. Namal University is erected to its West on a high pedestal in the foothill of a scenic mountaintop. The Student Support Office of Namal University is very active through various student societies to make the best use of this natural gift for recreational, sports and academic activities. namal dam The dam was built by the British Government in 1913 to conserve water coming from numerous streams of water that eventually gave shape to what is now Namal Lake. It was aimed at creating a water resource for irrigating vast tracts of barren land to the western side of Mianwali. For over a century the dam has served as a constant source of precious water for the farmers in the area. It also serves as an exciting excursion point for the tourists as Namal Lake winds through the mountains that make it an attractive point for boating across the lake up to the dam.",
