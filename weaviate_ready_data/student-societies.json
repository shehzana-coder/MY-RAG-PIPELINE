They not only allow students’ minds to flourish amid the hectic routine studies and frenzied curriculum but also allow them to exhibit their entrepreneurial, leadership and artistic skills along with sports. Keeping in mind all these aspects, Namal University has designed 12 active student societies that directly contribute to the further development of their recreational and vocational skills. Student societies consist of the general body and the executive body. General body consists of the general members. Any student of Namal University has the right to become a member of a society he/she is interested in. Patrons play important role and establish a bridge between executive members and Patron-in-Chief. The office of the Patron-in-Chief plays a pivotal role and monitors all the activities and plans of the Societies and Clubs. He is the focal person who conveys plans, concerns and suggestions to the offices of Registrar and Rector.  Proper representation minimizes the gaps and flaws in the execution of the planned activities. Eligibility Criteria for Executive Bodies A student, who wants to become a member of the executive body of a student society, must fulfil the following conditions: He/she must be a member of the general body for at least one year. He/she has not been involved in any disciplinary case throughout his /her Institute life. Should not be in the executive body of any other society at the same time.
