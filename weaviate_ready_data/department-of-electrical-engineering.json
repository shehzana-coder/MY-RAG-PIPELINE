This study develops and validates a deep learning framework for phonocardiogram (PCG) classification, focusing on model generalizability and robustness. Initially, a ResNet-18 model was trained on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, achieving high accuracy. To assess real-world viability, we conducted extensive external validation on the HLS-CMDS dataset. We performed four key experiments: (1) Fine-tuning the PhysioNet-trained model for binary (Normal/Abnormal) classification on HLS-CMDS, achieving 88% accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the same model for multiclass classification (Normal, Murmur, Extra Sound, Rhythm Disorder), which yielded 86% accuracy. (3) Retraining a ResNet-18 model with ImageNet weights directly on the HLS-CMDS data, which improved multi-class accuracy to 89%, demonstrating the benefit of domain-specific feature learning on the target dataset. (4) A novel stress test evaluating the retrained model on computationally separated heart sounds from mixed heart-lung recordings, which revealed a significant performance drop to 41% accuracy. This highlights the model’s sensitivity to signal processing artifacts. Our findings underscore the importance of external validation and demonstrate that while deep learning models can generalize across datasets, their performance is heavily influenced by training strategy and their robustness to preprocessing artifacts remains a critical challenge for clinical deployment. Machine Learning and Multivariate Analysis of Depression Prevalence and Predictors in Acute Coronary Syndrome 22-Oct-2025 Depression is a pervasive yet under-recognized comorbidity of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which further degrades cardiac outcomes, particularly in low-resource environments. A cross-sectional case–control study was performed at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, to quantify the burden of depressive symptoms and model key determinants. Two hundred eighty-six adults (150 ACS cases and 136 age-matched controls) completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Conventional statistics and five machine-learning classifiers—logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost, and a deep neural network—were benchmarked for detection and risk stratification. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9, were identified in 93.3% of ACS patients versus 18.4% of controls, and 66.7% of cases reported moderate-to-severe symptoms. Age ≥55 years (adjusted OR = 2.1, p < 0.01) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR = 1.9, p < 0.05) emerged as independent associated factors. Logistic regression achieved the best overall discrimination (accuracy = 0.93, AUC = 0.95), while the neural network yielded the highest F1-score (0.878). These findings highlight an overwhelming but addressable mental health gap in cardiology in Pakistan. Routine PHQ-9 screening coupled with algorithm-guided referral pathways could enable timely psychosocial interventions and ultimately improve both psychological well-being and cardiovascular prognosis in ACS patients. LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA: A hybrid Transformer based deep learning model for enhanced fish feeding intensity classification 05-Aug-2025 Accurate assessment of fish feeding intensity is important for efficient and sustainable aquaculture. This paper introduces LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA, a novel and parameter-efficient hybrid neural network for automated fish feeding intensity classification in aquaculture. Addressing the critical need for optimized feed management, our model utilizes the fusion of sonar imagery and Mel spectrograms to accurately assess feeding intensity levels. LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA integrates a Convolutional Neural Network branch for spatial feature extraction from sonar images with a Transformer branch for capturing temporal dynamics in Mel spectrograms, fused by a Feature Fusion and Interaction Aggregation (FFIA) module. Evaluated on the MRS-FFIA dataset, our model achieves a high validation accuracy of 95.42% and a macro-averaged F1-score of 95.40%, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-modal models while utilizing a significantly smaller parameter footprint (0.102 million parameters). The architectural novelty and parameter efficiency of LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA present a promising solution for real-time aquaculture monitoring, enabling optimized feed delivery, reduced waste, and improved sustainability. This work highlights the effectiveness of hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures for multi-modal underwater sensing and contributes a practically deployable model for intelligent aquaculture management. EEG electrode setup optimization using feature extraction techniques for neonatal sleep state classification 31-Jan-2025 An optimal arrangement of electrodes during data collection is essential for gaining a deeper understanding of neonatal sleep and assessing cognitive health in order to reduce technical complexity and reduce skin irritation risks. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data, a long-short-term memory (LSTM) classifier categorizes neonatal sleep states. An 16,803 30-second segment was collected from 64 infants between 36 and 43 weeks of age at Fudan University Children's Hospital to train and test the proposed model. To enhance the performance of an LSTM-based classification model, 94 linear and nonlinear features in the time and frequency domains with three novel features (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Lyapunov exponent, and multiscale fluctuation entropy) are extracted. An imbalance between classes is solved using the SMOTE technique. In addition, the most significant features are identified and prioritized using principal component analysis (PCA). In comparison to other single channels, the C3 channel has an accuracy value of 80.75% ± 0.82%, with a kappa value of 0.76. Classification accuracy for four left-side electrodes is higher (82.71% ± 0.88%) than for four right-side electrodes (81.14% ± 0.77%), while kappa values are respectively 0.78 and 0.76. Study results suggest that specific EEG channels play an important role in determining sleep stage classification, as well as suggesting optimal electrode configuration. Moreover, this research can be used to improve neonatal care by monitoring sleep, which can allow early detection of sleep disorders. As a result, this study captures information effectively using a single channel, reducing computing load and maintaining performance at the same time. With the incorporation of time and frequency-domain linear and nonlinear features into sleep staging, newborn sleep dynamics and irregularities can be better understood. Automated lumpy skin grading in bovine images using novel deep convolutional neural networks 05-Nov-2024 The diagnosis and prevention of lumpy skin disease, a viral ailment affecting cattle and buffalo, present significant financial implications for the livestock industry. Traditional methods for identifying lumpy skin disease rely on manual visual inspection by veterinarians, which can be labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to errors. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model for the automatic recognition and grading of lumpy skin disease from bovine images. The primary contributions of this research include the development of a DCNN architecture specifically tailored for this task, comprising five convolutional layers, five max pooling layers, two fully connected layers with ReLU activation, and a final fully connected layer with softmax activation. The model’s detection accuracy is further enhanced by applying image cropping and patching techniques, which divide each input image into 12 patches to improve local feature extraction. The proposed model was trained and tested using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. Comparative analysis was conducted against several state-of-the-art models, including InceptionV3, ResNet50, MobileNetV3, VGG19, and Xception. The DCNN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest validation accuracy of 0.96875, outperforming the compared models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, the study explores the potential of transitioning from binary to multiclass classification, which would allow for the assessment of the severity of lumpy skin disease. This future direction aims to provide more nuanced and actionable information for veterinary diagnostics. The significance of this research lies in its potential to offer an objective, efficient, and scalable solution for early disease detection and prevention in livestock, thereby presenting considerable economic benefits for farmers and the livestock industry as a whole. The methodology, including data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation, is comprehensively detailed to ensure reproducibility and to highlight the robustness of the proposed approach. Augmenting Aquaculture Efficiency through Involutional Neural Networks and Self-Attention for Oplegnathus Punctatus Feeding Intensity Classification from Log Mel Spectrograms 05-Jun-2024 Understanding the feeding dynamics of aquatic animals is crucial for aquaculture optimization and ecosystem management. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing fish feeding behavior based on a fusion of spectrogram-extracted features and deep learning architecture. Raw audio waveforms are first transformed into Log Mel Spectrograms, and a fusion of features such as the Discrete Wavelet Transform, the Gabor filter, the Local Binary Pattern, and the Laplacian High Pass Filter, followed by a well-adapted deep model, is proposed to capture crucial spectral and spectral information that can help distinguish between the various forms of fish feeding behavior. The Involutional Neural Network (INN)-based deep learning model is used for classification, achieving an accuracy of up to 97% across various temporal segments. The proposed methodology is shown to be effective in accurately classifying the feeding intensities of Oplegnathus punctatus, enabling insights pertinent to aquaculture enhancement and ecosystem management. Future work may include additional feature extraction modalities and multi-modal data integration to further our understanding and contribute towards the sustainable management of marine resources. EMG gesture signal analysis towards diagnosis of upper limb using dual-pathway convolutional neural network 24-Apr-2024 This research introduces a novel dual-pathway convolutional neural network (DP-CNN) architecture tailored for robust performance in Log-Mel spectrogram image analysis derived from raw multichannel electromyography signals. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of the proposed DP-CNN architecture across three datasets (NinaPro DB1, DB2, and DB3), encompassing both able-bodied and amputee subjects. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are employed for comprehensive evaluation. The DP-CNN demonstrates notable mean accuracies of 94.93 ± 1.71% and 94.00 ± 3.65% on NinaPro DB1 and DB2 for healthy subjects, respectively. Additionally, it achieves a robust mean classification accuracy of 85.36 ± 0.82% on amputee subjects in DB3, affirming its efficacy. Comparative analysis with previous methodologies on the same datasets reveals substantial improvements of 28.33%, 26.92%, and 39.09% over the baseline for DB1, DB2, and DB3, respectively. The DP-CNN’s superior performance extends to comparisons with transfer learning models for image classification, reaffirming its efficacy. Across diverse datasets involving both able-bodied and amputee subjects, the DP-CNN exhibits enhanced capabilities, holding promise for advancing myoelectric control. Improving Thyroid Disorder Diagnosis via Ensemble Stacking and Bidirectional Feature Selection. 01-Mar-2024 Thyroid disorders represent a significant global health challenge with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism as two common conditions arising from dysfunction in the thyroid gland. Accurate and timely diagnosis of these disorders is crucial for effective treatment and patient care. This research introduces a comprehensive approach to improve the accuracy of thyroid disorder diagnosis through the integration of ensemble stacking and advanced feature selection techniques. Sequential forward feature selection, sequential backward feature elimination, and bidirectional feature elimination are investigated in this study. In ensemble learning, random forest, adaptive boosting, and bagging classifiers are employed. The effectiveness of these techniques is evaluated using two different datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine-Machine Learning Repository, both of which undergo preprocessing steps, including outlier removal, addressing missing data, data cleansing, and feature reduction. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the remarkable success of proposed ensemble stacking and bidirectional feature elimination achieving 100% and 99.86% accuracy in identifying hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, respectively. Beyond enhancing detection accuracy, the ensemble stacking model also demonstrated a streamlined computational complexity which is pivotal for practical medical applications. It significantly outperformed existing studies with similar objectives underscoring the viability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. This research offers an innovative perspective and sets the platform for improved thyroid disorder diagnosis with broader implications for healthcare and patient well-being. Efficient thyroid disorder identification with weighted voting ensemble of super learners by using adaptive synthetic sampling technique 14-Aug-2023 There are millions of people suffering from thyroid disease all over the world. For thyroid cancer to be effectively treated and managed, a correct diagnosis is necessary. In this article, we suggest an innovative approach for diagnosing thyroid disease that combines an adaptive synthetic sampling method with weighted average voting (WAV) ensemble of two distinct super learners (SLs). Resampling techniques are used in the suggested methodology to correct the class imbalance in the datasets and a group of two SLs made up of various base estimators and meta-estimators is used to increase the accuracy of thyroid cancer identification. To assess the effectiveness of our suggested methodology, we used two publicly accessible datasets: the KEEL thyroid illness (Dataset1) and the hypothyroid dataset (Dataset2) from the UCI repository. The findings of using the adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling technique in both datasets revealed considerable gains in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The WAV ensemble of the two distinct SLs that were deployed exhibited improved performance when compared to prior existing studies on identical datasets and produced higher prediction accuracy than any individual model alone. The suggested methodology has the potential to increase the accuracy of thyroid cancer categorization and could assist with patient diagnosis and treatment. The WAV ensemble strategy computational complexity and the ideal choice of base estimators in SLs continue to be constraints of this study that call for further investigation. Efficient energy management for household: Optimization-based integration of distributed energy resources in smart grid 07-Aug-2023 Energy demand is increasing globally due to the growing human population and progressive lifestyle. The adequate use of available energy resources, including renewable, contributes to a country’s economic sustainability and future development. Optimization-based energy management and cost minimization plays a significant role in overcoming energy crises in less developed countries. In this paper, an optimization–based dynamic energy management technique for smart grids is developed based on the integration of available renewable resources and variable consumer demand, distinctive to underdeveloped countries. Consumer demand is classified into fixed, flexible, and highly variable based on population characteristics. In this work, we developed a Dynamic Multiple Knapsack DMKNS algorithm, which automatically schedules energy provision to various users by optimally accounting for the available resources (Grid and Renewable). The proposed method provides a low-cost solution by maintaining a constant energy supply while preserving consumer comfort and grid stability. The simulation results with various intermittent availability of resources using MKNS show a saving up to 50% for a variable energy demand user. The proposed method is general and can also be applied to various underdeveloped regions with similar consumer demand and statistics. Automated uterine fibroids detection in ultrasound images using deep convolutional neural networks 20-May-2023 Fibroids of the uterus are a common benign tumor affecting women of childbearing age. Uterine fibroids (UF) can be effectively treated with earlier identification and diagnosis. Its automated diagnosis from medical images is an area where deep learning (DL)-based algorithms have demonstrated promising results. In this research, we evaluated state-of-the-art DL architectures VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and our proposed innovative dual-path deep convolutional neural network (DPCNN) architecture for UF detection tasks. Using preprocessing methods including scaling, normalization, and data augmentation, an ultrasound image dataset from Kaggle is prepared for use. After the images are used to train and validate the DL models, the model performance is evaluated using different measures. When compared to existing DL models, our suggested DPCNN architecture achieved the highest accuracy of 99.8 percent. Findings show that pre-trained deep-learning model performance for UF diagnosis from medical images may significantly improve with the application of fine-tuning strategies. In particular, the InceptionV3 model achieved 90% accuracy, with the ResNet50 model achieving 89% accuracy. It should be noted that the VGG16 model was found to have a lower accuracy level of 85%. Our findings show that DL-based methods can be effectively utilized to facilitate automated UF detection from medical images. Further research in this area holds great potential and could lead to the creation of cutting-edge computer-aided diagnosis systems. To further advance the state-of-the-art in medical imaging analysis, the DL community is invited to investigate these lines of research. Although our proposed innovative DPCNN architecture performed best, fine-tuned versions of pre-trained models like InceptionV3 and ResNet50 also delivered strong results. This work lays the foundation for future studies and has the potential to enhance the precision and suitability with which UF is detected. Enhancing ductal carcinoma classification using transfer learning with 3D U-net models in breast cancer imaging 27-Mar-2023 Breast cancer ranks among the leading causes of death for women globally, making it imperative to swiftly and precisely detect the condition to ensure timely treatment and enhanced chances of recovery. This study focuses on transfer learning with 3D U-Net models to classify ductal carcinoma, the most frequent subtype of breast cancer, in histopathology imaging. In this research work, a dataset of 162 microscopic images of breast cancer specimens is utilized for breast histopathology analysis. Preprocessing the original image data includes shrinking the images, standardizing the intensities, and extracting patches of size 50 × 50 pixels. The retrieved patches were employed to construct a basic 3D U-Net model and a refined 3D U-Net model that had been previously trained on an extensive medical image segmentation dataset. The findings revealed that the fine-tuned 3D U-Net model (97%) outperformed the simple 3D U-Net model (87%) in identifying ductal cancer in breast histopathology imaging. The fine-tuned model exhibited a smaller loss (0.003) on the testing data (0.041) in comparison to the simple model. The disparity in the training and testing accuracy reveals that the fine-tuned model may have overfitted to the training data indicating that there is room for improvement. To progress in computer-aided diagnosis, the research study also adopted various data augmentation methodologies. The experimental approach that was put forward achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the benchmark techniques used in previous studies in the same field, and exhibiting greater accuracy. The presented scheme has promising potential for better cancer detection and diagnosis in practical applications of mammography. E2CNN: An efficient concatenated cnn for classification of surface emg extracted from upper limb 15-Mar-2023 Surface electromyography is a bioelectrical indicator that emerges during muscle contraction and has been widely used in a variety of clinical applications. Several prosthetic control applications can benefit from the analysis based on the classification of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. However, for the real-time application of upper limb prosthesis, the EMG-based systems need robust performance and rapid response behavior. In this study, we propose an efficient concatenated convolutional neural network (E2CNN) for classification of sEMG extracted from the upper limb. We have tested and validated the performance of the proposed E2CNN on two datasets: a longitudinal dataset comprising ten nondisabled (healthy) subjects and six transradial amputee subjects and spanning the data collected for a period of seven days; and the publicly available NinaPro DB1 dataset. The raw sEMG signals are converted into Log-Mel spectrograms (LMSs). This model combines the input layers with the output of each convolutional block using concatenation layers. The proposed E2CNN when applied to LMS-based images provides a good response time with high-performance accuracy of 98.31% ± 0.5% and 97.97% ± 1.41% for both nondisabled and amputee subjects. When applied to NinaPro DB1, the proposed E2CNN has attained a mean accuracy of 91.27%, an increase by 24.67% with respect to the baseline CNN model. The results show that the achieved results are comparable to those obtained using stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAEs) and other CNN models; however, E2CNN is associated with reduced training and prediction times, making it a potential candidate for real-time classification of sEMG based on LM spectrogram images. Effective kernel?principal component analysis based approach for wisconsin breast cancer diagnosis 14-Jan-2023 This work aims to identify cancerous (malignant) and non-malignant (non-cancerous) cells in a breast cancer database. Wisconsin breast cancer data (WBC) was utilized and obtained from the University of California, Irvine's machine learning repository. The proposed approach involves the Naive bayes algorithm with Gaussian distribution of the function in combination with Chi-squared-based attributes selection approach. This experimentation has been done after reducing the dimensional space of the used data with extended Kernel Principal Component Analysis (K-PCA). Five different kernels in K-PCA have been tested after the implementation of necessary pre-processing techniques. The performance assessment of the proposed system has been evaluated based on confusion matrix-based accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. Our proposed methodology with six selected feature and sigmoid K-PCA attained the best accuracy of 99.28%. This result outer performs many state-of-the-art studies recently published on the identical dataset. Spectral image-based multiday surface electromyography classification of hand motions using CNN for human–computer interaction 20-Sep-2022 Physiological signals such as electromyography (EMG) have been used in human–computer interaction (HCI) for medical applications. Wearable prostheses, such as robotic limbs, have seen a surge in popularity because of technological advancements in myoelectric interfaces. In spite of encouraging achievements with pattern-recognition-based control systems, user acceptability of prosthetic hands still needs improvement in control robustness. The purpose of this research is to compare multiday surface EMG (sEMG) recordings and measure the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance myoelectric control. The performance metrics used in this study are accuracy, macro weighted precision (MWP), macro weighted recall (MWR), and macro F1 -score for eight able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and four amputee subjects. Using Mel-spectrogram-based sEMG data from both the able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and amputee participants, our proposed CNN has achieved a mean classification accuracy of 99.42% ± 0.42% and 98.00% ± 0.58% for the able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and amputee subjects for the within-day analysis, respectively. The proposed CNN outperformed other classifiers ( p≤0.05 ) in the between-day analysis for twofold (65.88% ± 10.1% and 58.37% ± 9.11%) and for sevenfold validation (88.73% ± 1.43% and 77.35% ± 2.72%) using sEMG recordings from the able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and amputee subjects, respectively. The proposed CNN is compared with the pretrained transfer learning (TL) models and has achieved higher accuracy with lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that CNN can considerably increase the effectiveness of the pattern recognition myoelectric control schemes and can extract deep information from EMG data. Spectral Processing of Self-Mixing Interferometric Signal Phase for Improved Vibration Sensing under\nWeak-and Moderate-Feedback Regime 13-Aug-2019 In this paper, spectral processing of laser Self-Mixing (SM) interferometric signal phase has been carried out allowing better measurement accuracy for harmonic and arbitrarily shaped vibrations for an optical feedback based SM interferometric Laser Diode (LD) sensor. The resulting algorithm not only improves the measurement accuracy but also reduces the processing time (by a factor 3.45) as compared with a previous time-domain based displacement retrieval technique called the Phase Unwrapping Method (PUM). Fourier series based analysis of laser feedback phase is carried out to determine processing limits. The proposed algorithm has also been found to be robust against variation in optical feedback coupling C as well as additive noise. This use of spectral analysis not only increases the measurement accuracy but also retrieves information about target movement harmonics which can also be used in modal analysis applications of remote mechanical targets. Using an SM vibration sensor based on a LD emitting at 785 nm, this technique has provided an average RMS error of 12.5 nm (while that of PUM is 39 nm RMS) for harmonic target vibrations of 5 μm amplitude. For reduced range of 1 <; C <; 2, an average RMS error of ~8 nm (~λ/100) is obtained. Conference Publications Discrete Wavelet Transform for Laser Diode Self-Mixing Interferometry Processing for Vibrations Measurement 27-Nov-2024 Optical feedback interferometry, known for its efficient resource usage, contrasts traditional two-beam interferometry. Laser diode self-mixing interferometry (SM) is a prevalent remote sensing approach. Despite providing insights into target and laser diode dynamics, noise compromises SM interferometry’s efficacy. Leveraging time-frequency signal processing reduces noise in self-mixing signals. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the processing of self-mixing laser sensor signals, specifically focusing on leveraging the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for enhanced analysis. A Wavelet Transform-based Phase Unwrapping Technique is introduced, surpassing traditional methods like the Fast Fourier Transform, especially in handling non-stationary self-mixing (SM) signals. The technique’s key strength lies in its ability to simultaneously retain frequency and temporal information, effectively addressing challenges associated with dynamic signals. The proposed method ensures precise outcomes for stationary and non-stationary signals, marking a significant advancement in laser sensor signal processing. By harnessing DWT’s capabilities, the approach offers heightened accuracy and versatility, shaping the trajectory of SM signal analysis. Incorporating the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for SMI, our study achieved remarkable accuracy improvements. DWT-based processing resulted in an error of 12.77nm as compared to 60.98nm for RPUM, 5.95nm for FFT for stationary signals, and 11.98nm as compared to 64.64nm for RPUM and 1228nm for FFT for non-stationary signals, marking a significant advancement in laser sensor signal processing. Through this work, we provide a transformative avenue for advancing laser sensor research and elevating signal processing methodologies across disciplines.

Deep learning-based classification of wheat leaf diseases for edge devices 27-Nov-2023 This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for classifying wheat leaf diseases such as stripe rust and septoria for edge devices. The study used a 407 wheat leaf images dataset with three classes: healthy, stripe rust, and septoria. Data augmentation techniques created more training images once the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The classification was done using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a test set accuracy of 98.77%. The outcomes show that deep learning techniques are effective for accurately classifying wheat leaf diseases using cutting-edge devices, with potential for early detection in the field. Future work can include exploring advanced deep-learning techniques and larger datasets to enhance the model’s performance significantly. The proposed method can be used in various applications, such as mobile phone apps, to quickly and accurately detect wheat leaf diseases in the field. The potential impact of the proposed approach is significant, as it can help prevent crop loss and increase crop yield, leading to a more sustainable and food-secure future.

Leveraging training strategies of artificial neural network for classification of multiday electromyography signals 02-Dec-2022 It is essential to have an improved classification accuracy of target hand movements for the electronic prosthesis in order to work efficiently. As a result, twelve different artificial neural networks (ANN) training strategies have been analyzed, and their performances have been compared to discover the optimal training approach for Electromyography (EMG) signals. The proposed framework was also tested on multiday EMG data to assess its scalability performance. A Wearable MYO wristband is used to collect EMG data from eight participants. The experimental results demonstrate that resilient backpropagation can achieve a classification accuracy of 95%; however, it takes 24 seconds to execute and has a hidden layer size (HLS) of 16. Scaled conjugate gradient, on the other hand, obtained 87% classification accuracy with a 3-second execution time and an HLS of 8.

FARKHANDA AZIZ Lecturer Department of Electrical Engineering 199 farkhanda.aziz@namal.edu.pk Profile Publications Courses Projects Summary Academic Background MS in Electrical Engineering (   A Novel Machine Learning Based Approach for fault classification in Photovoltaic  Array  ) EME NUST 2020 Experience Lecturer CAE NUST 01-Mar-2022 -    26-Aug-2024 Journal Publications A Novel Convolutional Neural Network-Based Approach for Fault Classification in Photovoltaic Arrays 28-Feb-2020 Fault diagnosis in photovoltaic (PV) arrays is essential in enhancing power output as well as the useful life span of a PV system. Severe faults such as Partial Shading (PS) and high impedance faults, low location mismatch, and the presence of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) make fault detection challenging in harsh environmental conditions. In this regard, there have been several attempts made by various researchers to identify PV array faults. However, most of the previous work has focused on fault detection and classification in only a few faulty scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes deep two-dimensional (2-D) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from 2-D scalograms generated from PV system data in order to effectively detect and classify PV system faults. An in-depth quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach is presented and compared with previous classification methods for PV array faults – both classical machine learning based and deep learning based. Unlike contemporary work, five different faulty cases (including faults in PS – on which no work has been done before in the machine learning domain) have been considered in our study, along with the incorporation of MPPT. We generate a consistent dataset over which to compare ours and previous approaches, to make for the first (to the best of our knowledge) comprehensive and meaningful comparative evaluation of fault diagnosis. It is observed that the proposed method involving fine-tuned pre-trained CNN outperforms existing techniques, achieving a high fault detection accuracy of 73.53%. Our study also highlights the importance of representative and discriminative features to classify faults (as opposed to the use of raw data), especially in the noisy scenario, where our method achieves the best performance of 70.45%. We believe that our work will serve to guide future research in PV system fault diagnosis. Courses × search",

Academic Background MSc (  ) Kadir Has University 2024 BE (  ) Mehran University of Engineering and Technology 2021 Journal Publications Visuo-haptic exploration with relocated haptic feedback: impact of virtual and augmented reality 29-Jul-2025 Rendering haptic feedback on the wrist is an effective solution for freeing users' hands during virtual interactions while still providing haptic feedback, mostly focusing on Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Unfortunately, whether these solutions can be extended to Augmented Reality (AR) interactions has not been investigated before. In this paper, we investigate the perceptual differences between VR and AR environments with a user study experiment based on a stiffness discrimination task. Our findings revealed similar task accuracy and sensitivity in VR and AR but different exploration behaviors (i.e. higher interaction time in AR) and user experience (i.e. higher enjoyment and less mental fatigue in AR). Conference Publications Enhancing Eye-Hand Coordination in Volleyball Players: A Comparative Analysis of VR, AR, and 2D Display Technologies and Task Instructions 21-Oct-2024 Previous studies analyzed user motor performance with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Eye-Hand Coordination Training Systems (EHCTSs) while asking participants to follow specific task instructions. Although these studies suggested VR & AR EHCTSs as potential training systems for sports players, they recruited participants for their user studies among general population. In this paper, we examined the training performance of 16 professional volleyball players over 8 days using EHCTSs with three display technologies (VR, AR, and 2D touchscreen) and with four distinct task instructions (prioritizing speed, error rate, accuracy, or none). Our results indicate that volleyball players performed best with 2D touchscreen in terms of time, error rate, accuracy, precision, and throughput. Moreover, their performance was superior when using VR over AR. Eye-hand coordination training: A systematic comparison of 2D, VR, and AR display technologies and task instructions 16-Mar-2024 evious studies on Eye-Hand Coordination Training (EHCT) focused on the comparison of user motor performance across different hardware with cross-sectional studies. In this paper, we compare user motor performance with an EHCT setup in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and on a 2D touchscreen display in a longitudinal study. Through a ten-day user study, we thoroughly analyzed the motor performance of twenty participants with five task instructions focusing on speed, error rate, accuracy, precision, and none. As a novel evaluation criterion, we also analyzed the participants’ performance in terms of effective throughput. The results showed that each task instruction has a different effect on one or more psychomotor characteristics of the trainee, which highlights the importance of personalized training programs. Sustainable agriculture: an IoT-based solution for early disease detection in greenhouses 09-Jun-2023 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a cutting-edge paradigm that involves the interconnection of multiple advanced sensors and peripheral devices to enable the automation and orchestration of various complex systems. In the agricultural context, smart devices are utilized to acquire and transmit data from a diverse range of sensors that monitor intricate environmental parameters crucial to ensuring optimal plant growth. These factors encompass but are not limited to humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and water pH. Continuous monitoring and control of these environmental aspects are essential for maximizing plant growth and yield. Manual disease monitoring is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise in plant pathology. To overcome these challenges, convolutional neural network models employing deep learning techniques have been developed to detect and diagnose diseases in plants. On the effectiveness of virtual eye-hand coordination training with head mounted displays 25-Mar-2023 Eye-hand coordination training systems are used to train participants' motor skills and visual perception. Such systems have already been tested in Virtual Reality, and the results revealed that Head Mounted Display-based systems have the potential to improve the motor training. However, this was only investigated in an hour-long study. In the longitudinal study reported here, we analyzed the motor performance of three participants in ten sessions with three different assessment criteria, where participants were instructed to focus on speed, error rate, or complete the training freely (with no instructions). We also assessed the effective throughput performance of the participants. Our results indicate that effective throughput can be potentially used as an additional assessment criterion. We hope that our results will help practitioners and developers design efficient Virtual Reality training systems. Courses × search",

These system applications are endangered by severe disruptions due to critical faults in power electronic switches, which can cause whole system shutdowns and component damage. To reduce these risks and ensure reliable operation under faulty conditions, a robust Fault-Tolerant Control System (FTCS) for TPMC is essential. This paper introduces the diagnosed open-circuit switches fault and fault-tolerant control for TPMCs. The Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) unit is recommended for integration with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based FTCS to identify and isolate defective switches. The FDI unit is additionally outfitted with Modified Triple Modular Redundancy (MTMR) to ensure fault tolerance. To prevent system shutdowns and ensure process continuity, this system can detect faulty switches, isolate them, and then replace them with redundant ones. This strategy mitigates the impact of defective components on the system's overall performance by ensuring their prompt identification and repair. The proposed FTCS, together with MTMR and a cutting-edge FDI unit, will significantly improve the reliability. The MATLAB/Simulink results indicate that the proposed system provides 99.9 % reliability and ANN's parallel computations allow the system to offer fast fault detection. Investigations in this domain have demonstrated that the proposed methodology is an effective means of maintaining operational continuity despite the existence of open circuit failures. Hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Framework for Prosumers Energy Storage Systems in Smart Grids 11-Dec-2024 Modern power systems encompass multiple prosumers, smart grid technologies, and renewable energy resources (RERs). These prosumer-based smart grids are facing the reliability issues that can be mitigated through the adoption of competitive storage technologies. A range of competitive storage technologies have been developed by scientists. However, the systematic selection of best storage technologies is still one of the main challenging research issues in the current literature. To fill this literature gap, this paper proposes a multi-criteria decision framework for energy storage selection in prosumer-based networks. First, a decision-making hierarchy was developed based on the three main criteria including energy flow management for prosumers, technical features, and sustainability. Under these criteria, various sub-criteria were identified. Second, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem was solved for two cases using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods separately. Third, a hybrid AHP and PROMETHEE method was proposed for the selection of an efficient storage system for prosumers based smart grid. Finally, a comprehensive outlook has been provided for prosumer energy storage evaluation. Findings revealed several implications for more accurate storage evaluation decision making. For instance, sensitivity analysis reveals that the lithium ion battery (LIB) has the first preference in AHP method, and the lead acid battery (LAB) has the first preference in PROMETHEE method. However, the second preference for AHP method was the LAB, and the second preference for PROMETHEE method was the LIB. Hence, separate application AHP and PROMETHEE offered a slightly different ranking. According to the proposed hybrid procedure, LIB was ranked as the first option by both AHP and PROMETHEE methods. As a result, the hybridization of AHP and PROMETHEE methods offered a more robust and unique solution to the storage selection problem as compared to the individual method. Storage evaluation decision making has several implications for prosumer-based power systems. In future, only a few storage alternatives would not meet the needs of the large scale emerging power systems, such as peer-to-peer networks. In this situation, the rapid and accurate ranking of various competitive storage alternatives would be a challenging problem. This study is valuable because it offers a comprehensive and flexible decision making tool for storage evaluation for prosumer-based smart grids. For instance, the proposed model can be evaluated with addition or removal of criteria and storage alternatives under different situations. Damping sub-synchronous resonance in DFIG wind farms: An innovative controller utilizing wide-area measurement systems 01-Nov-2023 The use of series shunt compensators along with wind energy in power systems has increased significantly. One of the main disadvantages of wind energy and series compensation is the phenomenon of sub-synchronous amplification. In this paper, a control method with fuzzy system based on wide area measurement systems (WAMS) and considering time delay in order to increase the damping of sub-synchronous oscillations in compensated networks with capacitive compensators and wind turbines. The DFIG type is provided in the GSC converter’s voltage control loop for the system’s stable operation. The simulation results using MATLAB/Simulink software on Modified IEEE First Bench Mark test networks show the effectiveness of the proposed method in damping sub-synchronous oscillations in power systems compensated with series capacitors. Finite-time convergence of perturbed nonlinear systems using adaptive barrier-function nonsingular sliding mode control with experimental validation 01-Jul-2023 In this study, an adaptive barrier procedure is combined with nonsingular sliding mode control (SMC) technique at the aim of the fast stabilization of nonlinear system with external disturbances. It is verified that the barred function-based control law leads to the fast convergence of state errors to a region near origin. Furthermore, the suggested method eradicates the requirement for the knowledge of upper bounds of exterior perturbations which are frequently required in SMC scheme. The stability analysis confirms fast convergence of the error states to a predetermined region. In order to \nemonstrate the validity of the planned method, a mass-spring system is examined as the case study. Finally, simulation and experimental outcomes on a mass-spring system are given to prove the efficacy and success of the advised methodology. Barrier function-based adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode control technique for a class of disturbed nonlinear systems 01-Mar-2023 In this article, an adaptive non-singular terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) is designed based on a barrier function for the robust stability of a category of non-linear dynamic systems in the existence of the external disturbances. The planned approach implements a non-singular terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) to ensure robust performance with finite time convergence and singularity-free dynamics. It also uses Barrier Functions (BFs) as an adaptation approach for the NTSMC to attain the tracking errors’ convergence to a pre-defined neighbourhood of origin, with a controller gain that is not over-estimated and without requiring any knowledge about the upper bounds of disturbances. The Lyapunov-based stability analysis is carried out to confirm the asymptotic convergence of tracking errors to a pre-defined neighbourhood of zero. The effectiveness and performance of the planned approach is illustrated through simulations and experiments. Robust tracking composite nonlinear feedback controller design for time-delay uncertain systems in the presence of input saturation 07-Sep-2022 In this study, a robust control technique is investigated for the reference tracking of uncertain time-delayed systems in the existence of the actuator saturation. Due to emerging of some control complexities, as well as the input limitations, time-varying delay, uncertainty, and external disturbance, such a tracking goal would be realized through suitable design of the composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) controller. Thus, considering the mentioned limitations, a Lyapunov-based procedure is used to determine the control law. Then, the parameters of the CNF input are derived by using the solution of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. The planned tracking idea is numerically implemented in two uncertain control systems. Some performance characteristics (i.e., the tracking error, boundedness, and transient responses) are compared with similar ones. Accordingly, the simulations illustrate the efficiency of the suggested control procedure over the existing CNF approaches. A hybrid approach for fault location in power distributed networks: Impedance-based and machine learning technique 01-Sep-2022 Fault location (FL) is one of the challenges in distribution networks. Many impedance-based methods have been developed to address this challenge. However, these impedance-based methods are not yet able to provide a unique answer, and they only can approximate the distance of the fault from the reference point, which creates challenges in systems that have a large number of separate lines. In this paper, using the impedance method, as well as a deep neural network, a new method for FL is suggested, which can provide a unique answer. In this approach, the FL is determined in less than 6 s, and the accuracy of 99 percent. The deep memory neural network is then used to accurately detect the exact fault location between candidate points. This method also identifies the line where the fault occurred. The performed simulations confirm the validity of the proposed method. Synchronization and Anti-synchronization of Identical 4-D Hyperchaotic Financial System with External Perturbation via Sliding Mode Control Technique 29-Apr-2022 In this article, complete synchronization and antisynchronization in the identical financial chaotic system are presented. The proposed control strategies depend on first-order sliding mode and adaptive integral sliding mode for complete synchronization and antisynchronization of the identical financial chaotic system. In the primary case, the system parameters should be known, and first-order sliding mode control is utilized for synchronization and antisynchronization while in the second case, the system parameters are considered unknown. An adaptive integral sliding mode control strategy is utilized for synchronization and\nantisynchronization of the system considering the parameters unknown. The error system is changed into a particular structure containing a nominal part and several unknown terms to utilize the adaptive integral sliding mode control. Then, this error system is stabilized using integral sliding mode control. The stabilizing controller is usually developed based on the nominal part plus the compensator control part. To suppress the high-frequency oscillation (chattering) phenomenon, smooth continuous compensator control can be used rather than conventional discontinuous control. The compensator controller along with the adapted law is derived such that the time derivative of the Lyapunov function becomes strictly negative. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested through computer simulations. +e proposed control strategies are verified for that Identical 4D hyperchaotic financial system to attain complete synchronization and antisynchronization along with the improved performance. H?-based control of multi-agent systems: Time-delayed signals, unknown leader states and switching graph topologies 28-Apr-2022 The paper investigates a leader-following scheme for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). The network of agents involves time delay, unknown leader’s states, external perturbations, and switching graph topologies. Two distributed protocols, including a consensus protocol and an observer, are utilized to reconstruct the unavailable states of the leader in a network of agents. The H1-based stability conditions for estimation and consensus problems are obtained in the framework of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the LyapunovKrasovskii approach. It is ensured that each agent achieves the leader-following agreement asymptotically. Moreover, the robustness of the control policy concerning a gain perturbation is guaranteed. Simulation results are performed to assess the suggested schemes. It is shown that the suggested approach gives a remarkable accuracy in the consensus problem and leader’s states estimation in the presence of time-varying gain perturbations, time delay, switching topology and disturbances. The H1 and LMIs conditions are well satisfied\n, and the error trajectories are well converged to the origin. Adaptive nonsingular integral-type dynamic terminal sliding mode synchronizer for disturbed nonlinear systems and its application to secure communication systems 19-Apr-2022 This study proposes an adaptive nonsingular integral dynamic terminal sliding mode tracker/synchronizer for disturbed nonlinear systems along with its usage in safe communication systems. The convergence of the closed-loop structure under\nunknown uncertainty and disturbances is guaranteed via Lyapunov analysis. Furthermore, a parameter-tuning method is planned to approximate the upper bound of uncertainty and disturbance terms, since this latter is typically unknown in\npractice. The proposed approach is used to design a digital secure transmission scheme according to the chaotic systems. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is validated using computer simulations on a benchmark example of chaotic\nsystem. The obtained outcomes clearly confirm the ability of the planned control approach enables to attain the desired tracking/synchronizing performance despite the disturbances. Additionally, when implemented to the data encryption of\na communication system, the proposed control and secure communication techniques enabled the complete and secure retrieval of the original digital sequences. Prescribed performance attitude stabilization of a rigid body under physical limitations 23-Mar-2022 This study investigates the prescribed performance control problem associated with attitude stabilization of a rigid body, considering angular velocity constraint, actuator faults, and input saturation. The desired performance specifications in transient and steady-state phases including convergence speed,overshoot and steady-state value for attitude variable are also provided. To this end, the prescribed performance control methodology is combined with backstepping-based barrier Lyapunov function so as to develop a controller with simple structure compared to the existing constrained controls. The main idea behind the control design is to remove partial differential and complex function terms to considerably decrease complexity of the proposed controller. Moreover, a hyperbolic tangent function and an auxiliary system are employed to develop the constrained virtual rotation velocity control and to consider input saturation. The simulation results carried out on a rigid spacecraft confirm efficiency and success of the proposed constrained attitude control method. A Low-Complexity PD-Like Attitude Control for Spacecraft With Full-State Constraints 14-Mar-2022 The problem of attitude control for rigid spacecraft under the attitude and angular velocity constraints is investigated in this study. Particularly, a simple structure constrained proportional-derivative\n(PD)-like control is proposed which contains two portions. The first portion is a conventional PD control to provide convergence of the system states; whereas the second portion provides the desired performance specifications such as convergence rate, overshoot and steady-state bound for attitude and rotation velocity to improve the attitude pointing accuracy and pointing stability. A simple structure-constrained attitude control for rigid bodies: A PD-type control 18-Jan-2022 This study investigates the challenging and complicated issue of full-state constraint attitude control for rigid bodies under actuators physical limitation. Using the concept of prescribed performance\ncontrol (PPC), a novel proportional-derivative (PD)-type control is introduced by which both the attitude quaternion and the rotation velocity of the rigid body are enforced to possess specific behaviors in transient\nand steady state. To this end, a prescribed performance function (PPF) with finite-time convergence is first defined as the predefined boundaries for the quaternion and rotation velocity. Subsequently, a constrained\nPD-type attitude control for rigid body attitude system is developed. The significant difference between the proposed methodology and the PPC is the simple structure of the controller making it more applicable\nfrom practical implementation point of view. Indeed, due to the use of error transformation in the PPC, the controller contains partial derivative terms and complicated functions even for only constraining the\nattitude quaternion. When it comes to angular velocity constraint as well, the complexity of the control design procedure is doubled. It is rigorously proved that the suggested control framework can successfully satisfy\nconstraints not only on the quaternion but also on the angular velocity, simultaneously. These interesting results are obtained even when the actuator saturation is considered. The simulation results conducted on a\nrigid spacecraft verify the efficacy and applicability of the suggested constrained attitude control approach. Optimized Type-2 Fuzzy Frequency Control for Multi-Area Power Systems 28-Dec-2021 The objective of this study is minimizing the frequency deviation due to the load variations and fluctuations of renewable energy resources. In this paper, a new type-2 fuzzy control (T2FLC) approach\nis presented for load frequency control (LFC) in power systems with multi-areas, demand response (DR), battery energy storage system (BESS), and wind farms. BESS is used to reduce the frequency deviations caused by wind energy, and DR is utilized to increase network stability due to fast load changes. The suggested T2FLC is online tuned based on the extended Kalman filter to improve the LFC accuracy in coordination of DR, BESS, and wind farms. The system dynamics are unknown, and the system Jacobian is extracted by online modeling with a simple multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN). The designed LFC is evaluated through simulating on 10-machine New England 39-bus test system (NETS-39b) in four scenarios. Simulation results verifies the desired performance, indicating its superiority compared to a classical PI controllers, and type-1 fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). The mean of improvement percentage is about 20%. A Robust H? Fault Tolerant Controller for Uncertain Systems Described by Linear Fractional Transformation Model 26-Jul-2021 In this article, a robust H1 fault tolerant control law is addressed for a class of the uncertain dynamical systems represented via linear fractional transformation. To this objective, a state-feedback controller law is utilized for achieving the control objective. Thus, a linear matrix inequality based performance condition would be derived to guarantee that the disturbance suppression is accomplished in the uncertain system. Hence, the gains of the robust H1 controller would be suitably determined by checking the feasibility of such a linear matrix inequality problem. The proposed control technique is numerically simulated in two dynamical uncertain systems (i.e., a typical control system and a mechanical robotic arm). Considering the disturbance rejections and transient responses, the results illustrate the efficiency of the recommended robust technique compared with the existing control methods. Design of a non-singular adaptive integral-type finite time tracking control for nonlinear systems with external disturbances 19-Jul-2021 This paper proposes an adaptive non-singular fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) with integral surface for the finite time tracking control of nonlinear systems with external disturbances. An appropriate parameter-tuning adaptation law is derived to tackle the disturbances. A new fast terminal sliding scheme with self-tuning algorithm is proposed to synthesize the adaptive non-singular fast integral terminal sliding approach. The proposed approach has the following features: 1) It does not require the derivative of the fractional power terms with respect to time, thereby eschewing the singularity problem typically associated with TSMC; 2) It guarantees the existence of the switching phase under exogenous disturbances with unknown bounds; 3) Because of the integral terms in the sliding surface, the power functions are hidden behind the integrator; 4) It ensures chattering-free dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed using both a simulation and an experimental study. The obtained results showed that the FTSM control technique guarantees that when the switching surface is reached, tracking errors converge to zero at a fast convergence rate. Additionally, the integral term offers one extra degree-of-freedom and since the time-derivative of fractional power terms is not needed in the controller, the proposed switching surface provides a comprehensive framework for singularity avoidance. Optimal Economic Modelling of Hybrid Combined Cooling, Heating, and Energy Storage System Based on Gravitational Search Algorithm-Random Forest Regression 15-May-2021 The hybridization of two or more energy sources into a single power station is one of the widely discussed solutions to address the demand and supply havoc generated by renewable production (wind-solar/photovoltaic (PV), heating power, and cooling power) and its energy storage issues. Hybrid energy sources work based on the complementary existence of renewable sources. The combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) is one of the significant systems and shows a profit from its low environmental impact, high energy efficiency, low economic investment, and sustainability in the industry. *is paper presents an economic model of a microgrid (MG) system containing the CCHP system and energy storage considering the energy coupling and conversion characteristics, the effective characteristics of each microsource, and energy storage unit is proposed. *e random forest regression (RFR) model was optimized by the gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The test results show that the GSA-RFR model improves prediction accuracy and reduces the generalization error. *e detail of the MG network and the energy storage architecture connected to the other renewable energy sources is discussed. *e mathematical formulation of energy coupling and energy flow of the MG network including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV), CCHP system, fuel cell, and energy storage devices (batteries, cold storage, hot water tanks, and so on) are presented. The testing system has been analysed under load peak cutting and valley filling of energy utilization index, energy utilization rate, the heat pump, the natural gas consumption of the microgas turbine, and the energy storage unit. *e energy efficiency costs were observed as 88.2% and 86.9% with heat pump and energy storage operation comparing with GSA-RFR-based operation costs as 93.2% and 93% in summer and winter season, respectively. The simulation results extended the rationality and economy of the proposed model. Finite-time tracking controller design of perturbed robotic manipulator based on adaptive Second-order sliding mode control method 10-May-2021 This article presents an adaptive finite time second-order sliding mode tracking control scheme for robotic manipulators. A new control law is suggested to force the trajectories of the robot manipulator\nto move from all initial conditions to proportional-integral-derivative switching surface in the finite time and stay on it. Moreover, the adaptation law rejects the requirement of knowledge about upper bound of\nthe external perturbations. It is difficult to exactly determine the upper bound of the perturbations in the practical systems, such as robot manipulators. Unlike the existing methods, the new adaptive finite time\nsecond-order sliding mode tracker for n-link robot manipulators enables accurate tracking control, robust performance and parameter tuning. The suggested approach presents the design of a robust controller such\nthat the tracking errors of robot manipulator can reach the equilibrium in the finite time. Through the combination of the finite time tracker and disturbance observer, the position tracking purpose of manipulator\njoints is accurately performed not only in the nominal environment, but also in the existence of different types of perturbations. The robustness performance and effectiveness of the offered technique are studied in\nsimulation and experimental results. Adaptive Integral-Based Robust Q-S Synchronization and Parameter Identification of Nonlinear Hyperchaotic Complex Systems 30-Apr-2021 )is communique presents the Q-S synchronization of two nonidentical complex nonlinear hyperchaotic systems with unknown parameters. An adaptive controller based on adaptive integral sliding mode control and parameter update laws are designed to\nrealize the synchronization and parameter identification to a given map vector. )e aforementioned strategy’s employment demands the transformation of a system into a specific structure containing a nominal part and some unknown terms (later on,\nthese unknown terms will be computed adaptively). An integral sliding mode controller is used to stabilize the error system by designing nominal control accompanied by compensator control. For chattering suppression, a continuous compensator of\nsmooth nature is used instead of conventional control. )e stability of the proposed algorithm is established in an impressive way, using Lyapunov criteria. A numerical simulation is performed to illustrate the validity of the proposed synchronization scheme. Adaptive Sliding Mode Based Stabilization Control for the Class of Underactuated Mechanical Systems 08-Feb-2021 This article presents a simple stabilizing control algorithm for a class of underactuated mechanical systems for two degrees of freedom (2DoF). In this respect, the adaptive sliding mode based strategy is proposed for the considered class. The controller, along with the adapted laws, is decided in such a way that the time derivative of a Lyapunov function grows negative. Adaptive Smooth Super-twisting Sliding Mode Control of Nonlinear Systems with Unmatched Uncertainty 28-Sep-2020 This article presents a novel strategy regarding the stabilization control problem for plants with unmatched uncertainties. The methodology is based on Adaptive Smooth Super Twisting Sliding Mode Control. At first, as an initial step, the plant with unmatched uncertainty is transformed into a plant with matched uncertainty. At the second step, the plant with matched uncertainty is decomposed into a unique framework containing the nominal part and some unknown terms (where these unknown terms are computed adaptively). Compact CPW-fed super wideband planar\nelliptical antenna 01-Sep-2020 A compact co-planar waveguide (CPW) fed planar elliptical antenna has been designed and presented for super wideband (SWB) characteristics. The \ndesigned antenna has an overall size of 30 × 30 × 1.57 mm3, and it consists of an elliptical patch radiator fed using a modified 50 Ω CPW-fed tapered  icrostrip feed line. By using a semi-ring shaped structure with a tapered feed line, an impedance bandwidth of 180.66% has been observed from 1.27 to 25 GHz with a ratio bandwidth of 19.68:1. Modeling and Inverse Complex Generalized Synchronization and Parameter Identification of Non-Identical Nonlinear Complex Systems Using Adaptive Integral Sliding Mode Control 03-Mar-2020 This paper presents the Inverse Complex Generalized Synchronization (ICGS) of non-identical nonlinear complex systems with unknown parameters. Using the philosophy of adaptive integral sliding mode control, an adaptive controller and laws regarding parametric upgradation are designed to realize ICGS and parameter identification of two non-identical chaotic complex systems with respect to a given complex map vector. To employ the control, the error system is transformed into a unique structure containing a nominal part and some unknown terms, which are computed adaptively. Then, the error system is stabilized by using integral sliding mode control. Beveled-shaped super-wideband planar antenna 16-Jul-2018 In this paper, a design of beveled-shaped planar antenna has been presented for super-wideband applications. The proposed antenna consists of a beveled-shaped radiator, a tapered microstrip feed line, a partial ground plane, and two ground planes on the top side of the substrate. The top ground planes are used to match the impedance at lower frequencies and to minimize spurious radiations caused by the feed line. A tapered feed line has been utilized to enhance the overall bandwidth of an antenna. It has been observed from results that a ratio bandwidth of 66.6:1 has been achieved from 0.3 to 20 GHz. Furthermore, the proposed antenna exhibits good radiation characteristics and offers acceptable gain in the entire bandwidth. Synchronization of 4-D Hyperchaotic Rikitake Dynamo System  Along With Unknown Parameters Via   Adaptive Integral Sliding Mode 26-Mar-2018 An adaptive integral sliding mode control approach is proposed for the synchronization of 4-D identical hyperchaotic Rikitake dynamo system which operates with unknown parameters. The error dynamics are first transformed into a special structure which contains a known nominal part as well as unknown terms. The unknown terms are computed adaptively via an adaptive compensator, and the resulted error dynamics are stabilized asymptotically using integral sliding mode control. Smooth super-twisting sliding mode control\nfor the class of underactuated systems 10-Mar-2018 In this article, Smooth Super-twisting Sliding Mode Control (SSTWSMC) is investigated for the class of underactuated system. In underactuated systems, the control design is not directly applicable as for other systems (known as fully actuated systems). Therefore, at initial step, a nonlinear uncertain model of systems is transformed into the controllable canonical form, and then Smooth Super Twisting (SSTW) based Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is devised for the control design purpose for the considered class. A Comparative Experimental Study of Robust Sliding Mode Control Strategies for Underactuated Systems 12-Jul-2017 This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study for the tracking control of a class of underactuated nonlinear uncertain systems. A given nonlinear model of the underactuated system is, at first stage, transformed into an input output form and the driving applied control input of the transformed system is then designed via four sliding mode control strategies, i.e., conventional first order sliding mode control, second order sliding mode, fast terminal sliding mode, and integral sliding mode. Robust Control of Underactuated Systems: Higher Order Integral Sliding Mode Approach 12-Jan-2016 This paper presents a robust control design for the class of underactuated uncertain nonlinear systems. Either the nonlinear model of the underactuated systems is transformed into an input output form and then an integral manifold is devised for the control design purpose or an integral manifold is defined directly for the concerned class. Having defined the integral manifolds discontinuous control laws are designed which are capable of maintaining sliding mode from the very beginning. The closed loop stability of these systems is presented in an impressive way. The effectiveness and demand of the designed control laws are verified via the simulation and experimental results of ball and beam system.
