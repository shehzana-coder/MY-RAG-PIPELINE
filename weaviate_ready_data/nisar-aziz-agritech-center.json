SALEEM ULLAH Assistant Soil Chemist AgriTech 150 soilchemist@namal.edu.pk Profile Publications Courses Projects Summary Mr.Saleem Bourana obtained his M.Sc. (Hons) in Soil Science from the University of Sargodha in Pakistan. He started his work at the National Agricultural Research Institute (NARC). As a lab analysist, he worked\nin Engro Fertilizer Ltd and AJK Coal Mining Company (PVT). He previously joined the NAAC as an Assistant Soil Chemist at Namal University in Mianwali. He assists NAAC with agronomical experiments, field supervision at Namal AgriTech Park and research publications Academic Background MSc (Hons) Soil Science (INTEGRATED EFFECT OF BIOCHAR AND VERMICOMPOST ON PRODUCTION OF WHEAT (Triticum aestivum L.)  AND SOIL HEALTH ) UOS 2020 BSc (Hons) Soil and Environmental Science ( Relationship of Soil Physical & Chemical Properties with Aggregate Stability in Wheat Soil  ) UOS 2014 Journal Publications Past Trends and Future Outlook of Maize Crop Production Pattern in Pakistan 15-Oct-2025 This study analyzes the transformation of provincial maize production shares in Pakistan (2001–2023) using a Markov chain model and projects future trends (2024–2030) under a business-as-usual scenario. Results indicate Punjab’s dominant and expanding role in maize production, contributing over 90% by 2030. The findings highlight the need for policy interventions to promote regional diversification in maize cultivation for balanced agricultural growth. Assessment of various herbicides for weed management and their impact on wheat yield components in rice-wheat cropping system in punjab, pakistan 18-Feb-2025 Evaluating the efficacy and safety of herbicides is essential for sustainable weed management. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of selected herbicides in controlling weed populations, their impact on wheat growth parameters and their overall influence on wheat yield components in a rice-wheat cropping system in Punjab, Pakistan. The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate herbicides for optimal weed suppression and crop productivity. It also recommends integrated weed management strategies to address herbicide resistance and minimize environmental impacts. Interactive use of biochar and chemical fertilizer for improving nutrient availability and crop growth in rainfed area 30-Oct-2024 This study evaluated the combined effects of biochar and chemical nutrients on soil fertility and mash bean growth in rain-fed areas of Pakistan. Six treatments were tested to assess changes in soil properties, nutrient availability, and nitrogen fixation. Findings provide insights into biochar’s potential to enhance soil health, nutrient retention, and crop productivity in low-fertility soils. Challenges and opportunities to design future crops: gateway to sustainable agriculture in 21st century 19-May-2024 The global food production system is facing numerous challenges due to factors such as population growth, climate change, limited resources, and environmental preservation. Efficient utilization of agricultural resources is another important aspect of crop improvement. This includes developing crops that use water and nutrients more efficiently, reducing the need for irrigation and fertilizers, and minimizing environmental impacts. Increasing the resistance of crops to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events can also help reduce the use of pesticides and minimize crop losses. Overall, these strategies can help address the challenges faced by the global food production system.
