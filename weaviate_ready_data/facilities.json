This is achieved through social account and work account which all students are required to maintain at the bank. All students of Namal University are require to contribute 320 hours every year towards community service. Examples of community service include collection of waste, tuition services for school going children, plantation drives in the community, etc. Students will need to deposit their hours in the social account. Students who are on scholarships are required to contribute additional hours for on-campus and off- campus jobs. The hours should be deposited in the work account. Maximum of 320 hours per year are required to be deposited in the work account which will vary depending on the scholarship granted for each student. For example students on 100% scholarship will be required to contribute 320 hours while those on 50% scholarship will be required to contribute 160 hours per year . Jobs in this category include working on projects related to renewable energy, waste recycling, management of farms (olive orchards, vegetable farms, etc.), and other projects given by partners and Founding Members of Namal. Another way of looking at Time Bank is to understand that students have a maximum of 960 hours which they need to deposit in the bank. These hours can be divided as follows; one-third to be spent on community service, one-third on on-campus and off-campus jobs, and remaining one-third (i.e.320 hours) can be deposited in the Alumni Scholarship Fund in terms of equivalent rupee value after graduation. Contribution in the Alumni Scholarship Fund is not mandatory. Through Time Bank all students are able to learn and polish themselves professionally while learning the six Namal values. The Time Bank also greatly benefits the society at large while creating an atmosphere of sustainability.
