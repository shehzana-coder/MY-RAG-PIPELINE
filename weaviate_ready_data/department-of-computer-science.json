Many machine-learning approaches were proposed for the simplification of Reference Evapotranspiration (ET\n) predictions. There is also a need to explore the possibilities of daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET\n) predictions for the desert climate of Taif, Saudi Arabia. The study proposed machine learning-based daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET\n) predictions of Taif, Saudi Arabia. The weather data of Taif, from 2001 to 2023 is used to train and evaluate the performance of the Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoostR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine Regressor (LightGBMR) based machine learning models. The LightGBMR model outperformed other models for daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET\n) predictions of Taif, with a coefficient of determination (R\n) of 0.998, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.016 mm day−1, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.128 mm day−1, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.093 mm day−1, using twelve weather parameters. The feature importance of the LightGBMR model shows that weather parameters for ET\n predictions of Taif are important in order of wind speed (u\n), maximum temperature (T\n), relative humidity (R\n), solar radiation (R\n), extraterrestrial radiations (R\n), saturation vapor pressure (\n), actual vapor pressure (e\n), minimum temperature (T\n), net long-wave radiation (R\n), number of possible sunshine hours (N), net radiations (R\n), and number of actual sunshine hours (n). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the top five weather parameters can capture 99.6% variance for ET\n predictions of Taif. The LightGBMR model trained with top five weather parameters performed equally well as the LightGBMR model trained with all weather parameters, with a R\n of 0.998, a MSE of 0.016 mm day−1, a RMSE of 0.128 mm day−1, and MAE of 0.094 mm day−1. The study provides valuable insights for using appropriate weather parameters for the Reference Evapotranspiration (ET\n) predictions of Taif, Saudi Arabia.

Deep learning (DL) techniques have proved helpful in analysis and delineation of infectious regions in radiological images in a timely manner. This paper makes an in-depth survey of DL techniques and draws a taxonomy based on diagnostic strategies and learning approaches. DL techniques are systematically categorized into classification, segmentation, and multi-stage approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis at image and region level analysis. Each category includes pre-trained and custom-made Convolutional Neural Network architectures for detecting COVID-19 infection in radiographic imaging modalities; X-Ray, and Computer Tomography (CT). Furthermore, a discussion is made on challenges in developing diagnostic techniques in pandemic, cross-platform interoperability, and examining imaging modality, in addition to reviewing methodologies and performance measures used in these techniques. This survey provides an insight into promising areas of research in DL for analyzing radiographic images and thus, may further accelerate the research in designing of customized DL based diagnostic tools for effectively dealing with new variants of COVID-19 and emerging challenges.

Classification of Retroviruses Based on Genomic Data Using RVGC Retroviruses are a large group of infectious agents with similar virion structures and replication mechanisms. AIDS, cancer, neurologic disorders, and other clinical conditions can all be fatal due to retrovirus infections. Detection of retroviruses by genome sequence is a biological problem that benefits from computational methods. The National Center for Biotechnol-ogy Information (NCBI) promotes science and health by making biomedical and genomic data available to the public. This research aims to classify the different types of rotavirus genome sequences available at the NCBI. First, nucleotide pattern occurrences are counted in the given genome sequences at the preprocessing stage. Based on some significant results, the number of features used for classification is reduced to five. The classification shall be carried out in two phases. The first phase of classification shall select only two features. Unclassified data in the first phase is transferred to the next phase, where the final decision is taken with the remaining three features. Three data sets of animals and human retroviruses are selected; the training data set is used to minimize the classifier's number and training; the validation data set is used to validate the models. The performance of the classifier is analyzed using the test data set. Also, we use decision tree, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and vector support machines to compare results. The results show that the proposed approach performs better than the existing methods for the retrovirus's imbalanced genome-sequence dataset. Details × search",

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been employed to propose efficient and effective methods for rumor detection. In the wake of the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, the world has faced extensive strain on health, economics, and social structures. The dissemination of false or inaccurate information on social media, whether intentionally malicious or unintentional, has had detrimental consequences for individuals and society, particularly during critical situations like real world emergencies. In this study, we aim to explore the textual and temporal features present in social media posts (specifically tweets) related to COVID-19 to detect rumors as time is unique feature of text and any event can be mapped on timeline. Previous studies utilized the textual features and the temporal features are neglected at large for rumors detection. We utilize both temporal and textual features independently, as well as in combination, to train machine learning and neural network models. The evaluation of multiple algorithms (RNN, LSTM, CNN, DNN, BERT) across various feature sets reveals diverse performance. RNN and LSTM improve with combined textual and temporal features, highlighting temporal information’s importance. CNN performs well with textual features but declines with temporal features. DNN maintains consistent performance, while BERT demonstrates moderate effectiveness in classification tasks. A Novel Temporal Footprints-Based Framework\nfor Fake News Detection 30-Oct-2024 With the evolution of social media platforms, the detection of fake news and misinformation\nis gaining popularity. Social media platforms are the fastest source of fake news propagation, whereas\nonline news websites contribute to dissemination. In recent studies, the temporal features in text documents\nhave gained valuable consideration from the natural language processing (NLP) research community. This\nstudy investigates the importance of temporal features in text documents for detecting fake news. Later, the\ntemporal features are combined with the textual features to increase classifier performance. This research\nstudy uses Random Forest (RF) and Bi-LSTM techniques to classify fake news based on temporal features\nand textual features. A publicly available dataset was used to train and test the model. The experimental\nresults demonstrated that the proposed method achieved 99% accuracy by combining temporal and textual\nfeatures in fake news detection A Hybrid Deep Learning Based Fake News Detection System Using Temporal Features 10-Jun-2024 Detecting fake news and missing information is gaining popularity, especially after social media and online news platforms advancements. Social media is the main and speediest source of fake news propagation, whereas online news websites contribute to fake news dissipation. In this study, we propose a framework to detect fake news using the temporal features of text and consider user feedback to determine whether the news is fake or not. In recent studies, the temporal features in text documents gain valuable consideration from Natural Language Processing and user feedback and only try to classify the textual data as fake or true. This research article indicates the impact of recurring and non-recurring events on fake and true news. We use different models such as LSTM, BERT, and CNN-BiLSTM to investigate, and it is concluded that from BERT, we get better results, and 70% of true news is recurring, and the rest of 30% is non-recurring. Preventing 51% Attack By Using Consecutive Block Limits In Bitcoin 05-Mar-2024 In permissionless blockchain systems, Proof of Work (PoW) is utilized to address the issues of double-spending and transaction starvation. When an attacker acquires more than 50% of the hash power of the entire network, they gain the ability to engage in double-spending activities, posing a significant threat to the PoW consensus algorithm. This research focuses on the consensus algorithm employed in the Bitcoin system, explaining how it operates and the security challenges it faces. The proposed modification to the PoW algorithm imposes a restriction on miners: they are not allowed to accept consecutive blocks from the same miner into the final local blockchain to prevent the 51% attack problem. This modification supports transactions that require six confirmations. In the event an attacker attempts a 51% attack with a private chain that consists of fewer than 6 blocks, it becomes easier to detect a double-spending attack before accepting the attacker’s private chain. The modified algorithm introduces a “Safe Mode Detection Algorithm” that scrutinizes incoming blocks for adjustments at the top of the local blockchain. If inconsistencies are identified, the consensus algorithm proceeds cautiously by comparing the UTXO dictionaries from the attacker’s chain with those from the miner’s own blockchain. This meticulous comparison aims to detect instances of double-spending. If such instances are detected, the miner rejects the attacker’s chain, establishing a double-spend-free environment and thwarting 51% attacks. Event-Dataset: Temporal information retrieval and text classification dataset 18-Aug-2019 Recently, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) has grabbed the major attention of the information retrieval community. TIR exploits the temporal dynamics in the information retrieval process and harnesses both textual relevance and temporal relevance to fulfill the temporal information requirements of a user Ur Rehman Khan et al., 2018. The focus time of document is an important temporal aspect which is defined as the time to which the content of the document refers Jatowt et al., 2015; Jatowt et al., 2013; Morbidoni et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2018. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any standard benchmark data set (publicly available) that holds the potential to comprehensively evaluate the performance of focus time assessment strategies. Considering these aspects, we have produced the Event-dataset, which is comprised of 35 queries and set of news articles for each query. Such that,  where C represents the dataset, is query set and for each  there is a set of news articles \nare sets of relevant documents and non-relevant documents respectively. Each query in the dataset represents a popular event. To annotate these articles into relevant and non-relevant, we have employed a user-study based evaluation method wherein a group of postgraduate students manually annotate the articles into the aforementioned categories. We believe that the generation of such dataset can provide an opportunity for the information retrieval researchers to use it as a benchmark to evaluate focus time assessment methods specifically and information retrieval methods generically. Section-based focus time estimation of news articles 23-Nov-2018 Information retrieval systems embed temporal information for retrieving the news documents related to temporal queries. One of the important aspects of a news document is the focus time , a time to which the content of document refers. The contemporary state-of-the-art does not exploit focus time to retrieve relevant news document. This paper investigates the inverted pyramid news paradigm to determine the focus time of news documents by extracting temporal expressions, normalizing their value and assigning them a score on the basis of their position in the text. In this method, the news documents are first divided into three sections following the inverted pyramid news paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of four methods for splitting news document into sections: the paragraph-based method, the words-based method, the sentence-based method, and the semantic-based method (SeBM). Temporal expressions in each section are assigned weights using a linear regression model. Finally, a scoring function is used to calculate a temporal score for each time expression appearing in the document. These temporal expressions are then ranked on the basis of their temporal score, where the most suitable expression appears on top. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a diverse dataset of news related to popular events; the results revealed that the proposed splitting methods achieved an average error of less than 5.6 years, whereas the SeBM achieved a high precision score of 0.35 and 0.77 at positions 1 and 2, respectively. Temporal specificity-based text classification for information retrieval 26-Jun-2018 Time is an important aspect in temporal information retrieval (TIR), a subfield of information retrieval (IR). Web search engines like Google or Bing are common examples of IR systems. An important constituent of a search engine is news retrieval, where users present their information needs in the form of temporal queries. Users are usually interested in news documents focusing on a particular time period. Existing search engines rarely fulfill the temporal information requirements as they ignore the temporal information available in the content of news documents, also known as document focus time. Furthermore, information related to multiple time periods in a news document makes the identification of document focus time a challenging task. Therefore, it is necessary to classify news documents based on temporal specificity before it is possible to use the temporal information in the retrieval process. In this study, we formulate the temporal specificity problem as a time-based classification task by classifying news documents into three temporal classes, ie high temporal specificity, medium temporal specificity, and low temporal specificity. For such classification, rule-based and temporal specificity score (TSS)-based classification approaches are proposed. In the former approach, news documents are classified using a defined set of rules that are based on temporal features. The later approach classifies news documents based on a TSS score using the temporal features. The results of the proposed techniques are compared with four machine learning classification algorithms: Bayes net, support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree. The … Comparative analysis of information retrieval models on Quran dataset in cross-language information retrieval systems 15-Nov-2011 English is an international language used for communication worldwide but still many cannot read, write, understand, or communicate in English. On the other hand, the World Wide Web has unlimited resources of information in different languages which English native find challenging to understand. To avoid such barriers, Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems are proposed, which refers to document retrieval tasks across different languages. This work focuses on the performance evaluation of different Information Retrieval (IR) models in CLIR system using Quran dataset. Furthermore, this work also investigated the length of query and query expansion models for effective retrieval. The results show that different length of queries has an impact on the performance of the retrieval methods in terms of effectiveness. Hence, after comprehensive experiments, an appropriate length of query for Arabic CLIR system is suggested along with the best query expansion and retrieval model.

The auditory\nfeedback adaptively changes that changing based on user mode.\nActive users are assigned with speech only while the engaged users with the non-speech only auditory feedback. Ten participants\nperform tasks on desktop computers using within-subject design. The proposed adaptive auditory feedback is more efficient in\ncomparison to speech only and non-speech auditory feedbacks.\nIt can also improve a user experience in the desktop environment. Finally, it may help dierent researchers to use adaptive auditory\nfeedback as a substitute for speech only or non-speech auditory feedback during the designing of accessibility software, tools, and\nsystems.

The main focus of this research is to build a task-scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous environment. We proposed an algorithm named parental prioritization earliest finish time. It has two phases, task prioritization phase and processor assigning phase. In the tasks prioritization phase, tasks will schedule in the parental priority queue (PPQ) on the basis of downward rank and parental priority. Task prioritization is based on the directed acyclic graph. It can schedule the task of successor row before the current row if it has less communication cost. In the processor assigning phase, the processor will allocate to the scheduled tasks obtained from PPQ keeping the computation cost to a minimum. This proposed algorithm is compared with HEFT and CPOP algorithms through graphs generated from a random task graph generator and a set of tasks. The experimental results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs significantly better than other algorithms in terms of both cost and makespan of schedules. Conference Publications Flexible Genetic Algorithm Operators for Task Scheduling in Cloud Datacenters 29-Jan-2021 Cloud computing is the backbone of the modern information technology industry. Due to the increase in internet usage, social media, and smart phones, a large amount of data is producing. Cloud datacenters can provide resources to handle this data. If data is not properly handled, it can cause overhead on cloud servers and can increase operational costs. Genetic algorithm is used to solve scheduling problem efficiently, but they take a lot of time to find an optimal solution. In this paper, we proposed Flexible Genetic Algorithm Operators (FGAO) for Task Scheduling in Cloud Datacenters. This algorithm changes crossover and mutation operators according to the quality of scheduling solutions. Instead of giving a fixed stopping criteria algorithm uses flexible crossover and mutation operators as a stopping criterion. Experimental results show that the proposed FGAO algorithm reduces 40% execution time and 33% iterations as compared to the genetic algorithm.
